    //     Hey, I'm Tayte - a caffiene addicted Software Engineer that resides in
    //     the snowy mountains of Utah. I'm currently working as a Frontend
    //     Engineer at MX, a Fintech Startup headquartered in the Silicon Slopes. I
    //     help build and maintain the frontend for the MoneyMap, Finstrong, and
    //     Pulse personal financial management tools that are used by millions of
    //     human beings everyday.
    //   </Text>
    //   <Text color="gray.600" lineHeight={2} fontSize="xl" mt={4}>
    //     Outside of my work and code life, I really enjoy trying to make the most
    //     of what this beautiful life has to offer. I'm always trying to get
    //     outdoors and I'm thankful to live in a place that has so much to offer.
    //     You can usually catch me riding my skateboard, hitting the slopes when
    //     it's snowing, trying out new hiking trails, doing a little offroading,
    //     and looking for the next best camping spot.
    //   </Text>
    //   <Text color="gray.600" lineHeight={2} fontSize="xl" mt={4}>
    //     I also have a passion for problem solving and bringing ideas into
    //     reality. Innovation excites me so I am always looking for new
    //     technologies to learn about and stay updated on.
